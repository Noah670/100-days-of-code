# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 17, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Gantt charts as a visual way to represent a projects requirements using Lucidchart.

### Day 2: November 18, 2020, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Created a Gantt Chart timeline with Lucidchart

**Thoughts**: I think the Gantt Chart turned out very well and I can see the importance it provides for scheduling projects across teams

### Day 3: November 19, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced various sorting algorithms including Insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

**Thoughts** Learning about the different run times for each of the different algorithms was interesting and I can defintiely see the advatnage an algorithm such as Quick Sort has over insertion sort with a large data set.

### Day 4: November 20, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented selection sort and quick sort into a C++ program that sorts a CSV auction file alphabetically.

**Thoughts**  After implementing the quick sort and selection sort algorithms I noticed the huge difference in performance between the two data structures. Quick sort was able to sort all of the bids in a fraciton of a second compared to selection sort which took almost 10 times as long.
