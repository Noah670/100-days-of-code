# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 17, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Gantt charts as a visual way to represent a projects requirements using Lucidchart.

### Day 2: November 18, 2020, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Created a Gantt Chart timeline with Lucidchart

**Thoughts**: I think the Gantt Chart turned out very well and I can see the importance it provides for scheduling projects across teams

### Day 3: November 19, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced various sorting algorithms including Insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

**Thoughts** Learning about the different run times for each of the different algorithms was interesting and I can defintiely see the advatnage an algorithm such as Quick Sort has over insertion sort with a large data set.

### Day 4: November 20, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented selection sort and quick sort into a C++ program that sorts a CSV auction file alphabetically.

**Thoughts**  After implementing the quick sort and selection sort algorithms I noticed the huge difference in performance between the two data structures. Quick sort was able to sort all of the bids in a fraciton of a second compared to selection sort which took almost 10 times as long.

### Day 5: November 21, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned the basics of Solidity, a programming langauge for implementing smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain.

**Thoughts**  Solidity provides a lot of great support and I was surprised to see how fast you could get an application up and running with the provided documentaiton, along with the Remix IDE which can be used to build Ethereum contracts directly with Solidity and debug transactions.

### Day 6: November 22, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created a web application using Three.JS to display the location of a popular tourist destination in Saipan, the Northern Marianas Islands.

**Thoughts**  Utilizing the Three.js framework for the web application was an interesting process, I also had to figure out how to convert the panorama of Saipan into a six sided shape skybox to use within the Three.js Orbit controls.

### Day 7: November 22, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on implementing a hash table into a C++ program with the chaining method for detecting collisons.

**Thoughts**  Creating the hash table I learned the versatility a properly done hashing algorithm provides to an application. I also learned a hash table is very fast at searching or removing items from a list. For example, a good hashing algorithm is capable of inserting an item with a time complexity of just O(1) while a typical search using something like a stack would take O(n).
