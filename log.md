# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 17, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Gantt charts as a visual way to represent a projects requirements using Lucidchart.

**Link to work:** [Gantt Chart documentation](https://wiki.easyvista.com/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/Gantt+Chart)

### Day 2: November 18, 2020, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Created a Gantt Chart timeline with Lucidchart

**Thoughts**: I think the Gantt Chart turned out very well and I can see the importance it provides for scheduling projects across teams

### Day 3: November 19, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced various sorting algorithms including Insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

**Thoughts** Learning about the different run times for each of the different algorithms was interesting and I can defintiely see the advatnage an algorithm such as Quick Sort has over insertion sort with a large data set.

### Day 4: November 20, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented selection sort and quick sort into a C++ program that sorts a CSV auction file alphabetically.

**Thoughts**  After implementing the quick sort and selection sort algorithms I noticed the huge difference in performance between the two data structures. Quick sort was able to sort all of the bids in a fraciton of a second compared to selection sort which took almost 10 times as long.

### Day 5: November 21, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned the basics of Solidity, a programming langauge for implementing smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain.

**Thoughts**  Solidity provides a lot of great support and I was surprised to see how fast you could get an application up and running with the provided documentaiton, along with the Remix IDE which can be used to build Ethereum contracts directly with Solidity and debug transactions.

### Day 6: November 22, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created a web application using Three.JS to display the location of a popular tourist destination in Saipan, the Northern Marianas Islands.

**Thoughts**  Utilizing the Three.js framework for the web application was an interesting process, I also had to figure out how to convert the panorama of Saipan into a six sided shape skybox to use within the Three.js Orbit controls.

### Day 7: November 22, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on implementing a hash table into a C++ program with the chaining method for detecting collisons.

**Thoughts**  Creating the hash table I learned the versatility a properly done hashing algorithm provides to an application. I also learned a hash table is very fast at searching or removing items from a list. For example, a good hashing algorithm is capable of inserting an item with a time complexity of just O(1) while a typical search using something like a stack would take O(n).

### Day 8: November 24, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about UML use case diagrams for describing system and created my own use digram through Lucid chart.

**Thoughts**  I enjoyed learning about use case diagrams and realized how important they for any system being built. I also learned how UML use case diagrams can be used to represent the different actors and “use cases” for a particular system and various relationships such as extending and inhertitance.

### Day 9: November 25, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the Electron framework to build a desktop application that displays my existing website and the current version of Node.js installed

**Thoughts**  I had fun working with the Electron framework and can see how beneficial it is for creating multiplatform apps across Mac, Windows, and Linux. Electron has great documentation and the build and installation process is simplifeid with NPM and the Electron forge tool.

### Day 10: November 26, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on creating a Binary Search Tree that can find, read, and remove items from a list in C++.

**Thoughts**  It was interesting to implement a Binary Search tree within C++ and figure out the different cases depending on the type of node we want to remove from the tree such as a leaf node or node with two children.

### Day 11: November 27, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my idea for creating a breakout style inspired game within Javascript.

**Thoughts**  I was inspired to work on this idea I had for breakout style game and have implemented the basic playable state of the game with the paddle and bricks.

### Day 12: November 28, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my game project now called Pure Breakout which includes new features such as a dark mode and randomly generated block colors. 

**Thoughts**  I incorporated new features and ideas into Pure Breakout and I really like the way the overall presentation of the game turned out along with the background music.

### Day 13: November 29, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created more of my UML diagrams to practice different notations and class strucutures

**Thoughts**  I was able to finish several different diagrams for my project including my use cases, activity diagram, sequence diagram, and overall class strucurue.

### Day 14: November 30, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Complied together some of my different programs on data strucures and algorithms into one big portfolio project.

**Thoughts**  Reflecting upon all of the different data strucures and algorithms that I learned about such as binary search trees, doubly linked-lists, and hash tables was a great exercise and reinforfced my knowldege on when to use specific data structures while programming.

### Day 15: December 1, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Discovered Code analogies and decided to read through some of the web development tutorials and Javascript concepts for practice.

**Thoughts**  The way code analogies explains various concepts in an intuitive way through pictures and common explanations is a great resource to find. I will be using code analogies in the future along with their interactive examples.

### Day 16: December 2, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Went back to CodeWars and started solving some challenging puzzles to help sharpen my javascript skills.

**Thoughts**  I really found CodeWars to be a great tool for me and also engaging with other developers discussing how they worked through a solution was interesting. I will definitely be using CodeWars more in the future to practice my languaage skills.
